# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game played between two players. The game has simple rules:

Rock beats Scissors: If a player chooses Rock and the other player chooses Scissors, the player who chose Rock wins.

Paper beats Rock: If a player chooses Paper and the other player chooses Rock, the player who chose Paper wins.

Scissors beats Paper: If a player chooses Scissors and the other player chooses Paper, the player who chose Scissors wins.

If both players choose the same item, it's a tie, and the game is usually played again to determine the winner.

For this game, the player will be playing against the computer that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.
